It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to theme.scss. The webpage will be on the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nThe GitHub Action installs R so you can have R code in your qmd or Rmd files. Note, you do not need to make changes to your Rmd files unless your need Quarto features like cross-references.",
